## 4 The Magic Behind the Mystery

As we warned in the beginning, there's a lot going on behind the scenes: in ``lfetool``, ``rebar``, and even LFE itself. This guide just gives you a quick taste of the LFE flavour :-) Before parting ways, though, there are some more bits we should share.


### 4.1 Using ``make`` in ``lfetool`` Projects

We promised to come back to ``make``, so here we are.

Eventually, the ``Makefile`` will be replaced with a combination of ``rebar``
scripts and updates to ``lfetool``, but for now it's what we've got.

There are some convenient targets available for you in the ``Makefile``:

* ``upload`` - when your project's ready for release, this will push it up to
  <a href="http://expm.co/">expm.co</a> for you
* ``compile`` - rebuilds all your ``.beam``s, including the dependencies
* ``install`` - should you wish to install your project system-wide (we recommend
  against it), you could use this target to do it
* ``check`` - run your unit, integration, and system tests after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files ``*.beam``
* ``repl`` - start up the LFE REPL after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files
* ``shell`` - start up the Erlang shell after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files
* ``get-deps`` - ensure that all your dependencies have been downloaded; you can update these later with ``$ lfetool update deps``
* ``get-version`` - get project and component version numbers

If you do not need to recompile dependencies (and most of the time, you don't),
you can skip the deps with the following targets:

* ``compile-no-deps``
* ``repl-no-deps``
* ``shell-no-deps``
* ``check-unit``

There are other interesting ``make`` targets tucked in the ``Makefile``, and
you can learn more about how to manage LFE projects by checking them out.


### 4.2 The LFE REPL

We barely touched upon the LFE REPL in this guide; if you're like many other Lispers, you will spend a considerable amount of your dev (or at least planning) time in the REPL. More information on the LFE REPL is available in the following locations:

* <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/blob/develop/doc/lfe_shell.txt">LFE codebase docs - Lisp Flavoured Erlang shell</a>
* <a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/2.html">User Guide - The LFE REPL</a>

### 4.4 Feedback and Docs Bugs

If you would like to provide feedback about this guide, we would welcome the chance to improve the experience for everyone. Please

sure to give a full description so that we can best help you!


### Next Stop

There are any number of things you could tackle next, depending upon your general programming experience, learning style, and interest in LFE. Here are some ideas:

* Read up on Erlang itself -- [the site](http://erlang.org/) has links to great Erlang books
* Read the source code for various projects in the [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) organisation on Github
* [Watch LFE presentations](http://docs.lfe.io/presentations.html)
* Read up on [Lisp, Erlang, and LFE history](http://docs.lfe.io/history.html)
* Fix a bug in:
  * [LFE Docs](https://github.com/lfe/docs/issues)
  * An [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) project
  * [LFE itself](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/)!
* Create a project of your own :-D
