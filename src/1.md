This is a quick-start, a blur of color. You're not going to get very many
details here, but you *will* get to jump into the LFE REPL and see a little
code in action.

For those that would enjoy a more gradual introduction (with a bit more Erlang)
thus having the time to see the stars (and not just stunning plaid), you may be
interested in checking out the
<a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/1.html">User Guide</a>.


### 1.1 LFE

LFE, or "Lisp Flavored Erlang", is a Lisp-2 (similar to Common Lisp in that way) that runs on top of the Erlang VM or "BEAM". It is the oldest sibling of the many BEAM languages that have been released since its inception (e.g., Elixir, Joxa, Luerl, Erlog, Haskerl, etc.).

As a Lisp-2, LFE has different namespaces for functions and variables. Furthermore, LFE has Erlang's notion of arity, so functions with different arity may share the same name.

Before we jump into LFE, though, you'll need to have the minimal set of dependencies installed on your machine.


### 1.2 lfetool

Many in the LFE community use ``lfetool``, a utility specifically designed for
creating LFE projects of various types, complete with stubbed code and unit
tests. For the purposes of a quick start, all of your LFE workflow needs can be
met by  ``lfetool``. This guide will use it almost exclusively -- all in the
interst of sending you a week and a half into the future.

You can install ``lfetool`` with the following, which will install it into
``/usr/local/bin``:

```bash
$ curl -L -o ./lfetool \
    https://raw.github.com/lfe/lfetool/stable/lfetool
$ bash ./lfetool install
```

If you would like to instal it in a different directory, you may use the
following verbose command form:

```bash
$ bash ./lfetool install lfetool /opt/scripts/bin
```

Note that ``lfetool`` supports Erlang R15, R16, and 17.

If you need ``sudo`` to put the script there, be sure to set the ownership:

```bash
$ chown $USER /usr/local/bin/lfetool
```

That way you'll be able to use the ``update`` command to get the latest version
of ``lfetool`` in the future.


### 1.3 Other Dependencies


#### Erlang

First and foremost, you will need Erlang installed.

 * On Mac OS X, this is as easy as executing ```brew install erlang```
 * On Ubuntu ```apt-get install erlang```.

You can also install Erlang from the various pre-built packages
provided on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">official Erlang
download page</a> or from the
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp">Erlang
Solutions page</a> (which supports many more package types).

#### make

In order to use LFE, you will be calling ``make`` to compile it. To cover your bases, you'll want to make sure you have the basic development tools installed for your platform.

Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

CentOS/Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

For Mac OS X, you will need to install the "Developer Tools" from the AppStore.


#### git

You will also need ``git`` to continue with this quick-start. If ``git`` doesn't come installed on your system and it wansn't installed as part of your systems basic development tools package, you can <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download it here</a>
or install it using your favourite OS package manager.


#### rebar

``rebar`` is a tool for managing project dependencies, compiling them, and
compiling your project's source code. Most recent Erlang projects have a
``rebar.config`` file in them, indicating their support of ``rebar``.

``lfetool`` uses ```rebar``` to build LFE as well as managing dependencies for
your projects, so go ahead and get that set up:
<a href="https://github.com/basho/rebar">download rebar</a> and follow the
instructions in the project ``README`` on Github.


#### Optional

If you would like to easily have multiple versions of Erlang installed (or be
available for installation) on your system,
[kerl](https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) might be the tool for you. If
you have used such tools as ``virtualenv`` in Python or Ruby's RVM, then you
should be quite comfortable with the concepts behind kerl.

Most people don't need to work with multiple versions of Erlang, however;
please consider carefully before unnecessarily complicating your development
environment.
