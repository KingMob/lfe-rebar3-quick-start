The rest of this quick-start assumes that you've followed the links in the previous section and have installed both Erlang as well as `rebar3`.

This _is_ a quick-start, though: a blur of color. You're not going to get very many
details here, but you _will_ get to jump into the LFE REPL and see a little
code in action.

For those that would enjoy a more in-depth introduction and would appreciate having the time to see the stars (and not just stunning plaid), you may be
